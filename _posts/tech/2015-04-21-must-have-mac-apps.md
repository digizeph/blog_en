Because recently, I've been working on some side projects that involve constantly reinstall my OSX, and I hate to remember all the softwares I need to install for every single time. So here we are, my list of all the must-have softwares for a fresh Yosemite.

```
EDIT: add some more on Oct. 17, 2014.

EDIT: add MacVim, Spotify, VLC, Plex, XMind on Oct. 27, 2014.
```

Apps:

* Chrome (Safari is the fastest browser to download Chrome, IE is the second)
* iWork set
	* Keynote
	* Numbers
	* Pages (barely use)
	* iPhoto
	* iMovie (just in case I have nothing to do)
* iTerm 2 - the best terminal emulator on Mac and I don't know why. It is just good.
* 163 Music (you need to at least know some Chinese to appreciate it)
* Dropbox
* Wunderlist
* Evernote
* Alfred (I like to set the key to be double tap "command")
* Feedly
* Mint
* Skitch
* Caffine
* Intellij (for Java development, note it requires Java SE 6 runtime to run and will install on start)
* cdto (a nice plugin for finder to open iterm at current folder)
* Baidu Input Method (for Chinese input, download is always painfully slow)
* OmniGraffle
* QQ
* Cinch (search "irradiated")
* Mendeley (best tool for paper reading)
* Skype
* LyX (quick write up for school homework)
* SourceTree (to quick manipulate git repo)
* MacVim (Open text file with Vim!) (use the RCDefaultApp to change the default app setting)
* RCDefaulApp (change default application for extensions)
* Spotify (nice radios)
* VLC (yet another video player)
* PlexHomeTheater (watching videos could be fun)
* XMind (Mind mapping)

Command line tools and panel:

* Homebrew:
* Subversion (use brew)
* MacTeX
* Aria2 (use brew) (best downloading tool)
* JDK 7 and 8
* [RCDefaultApp](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14618/rcdefaultapp) (a control panel to change the default application for files)

Games:

* unnethack (use brew) (yes, Nethack and better!)
* FTL

Other settings:

* VPN Gate
	* I use Tsubuka's
	* vg2947755109.opengw.net
