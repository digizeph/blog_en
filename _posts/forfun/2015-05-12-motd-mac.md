Recently, I've been "remodeling" my private hackintosh server, and installed to 32 GB of RAM on that little beast.
It is now a pretty satisfying machine with descent power to run all the experienments that I need to conduct.

Now, it is the time to name it. Previously, I just use hackintosh for this.
But I figured this is not a proper way to name a *scientific experimental server*.
So I decided to name it _**HT-1**_ (still from the hackintosh name though, but with sequence now).

In order to better remember and use the new name, I changed the [MOTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motd_(Unix)) (message of the day) to a ASCII art version of _**HT-1**_.

### Step 1: get the ASCII art text

The fonts are Big Money-sw and Straight.

		        $$ |  $$ |$$$$$$$$/     / $$ |
		        $$ |__$$ |   $$ | ______$$$$ |
		        $$    $$ |   $$ |/      | $$ |
		        $$$$$$$$ |   $$ |$$$$$$/  $$ |
		        $$ |  $$ |   $$ |        _$$ |_
		        $$ |  $$ |   $$ |       / $$   |
		        $$/   $$/    $$/        $$$$$$/

		                Happy hacking!

		

### Step 2: change the MOTD

Edit the file `/etc/motd` and paste the ASCII text into this file.
Whatever changes you make on this file will reflect to the login screen of your commandline terminal or SSH sessions.

Here is what it looks like when you open a terminal in Mac:
